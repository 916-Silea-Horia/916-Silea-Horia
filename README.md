- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Silea Horia
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in informatics
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Science and Mathematics at Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca
- I participated in the following contests:
  - Cloudflight Coding Contest 39th edition hosted at UBB FSEGA (19.04.2024). I led a team composed of me and two of my colleagues and we completed 4 out of the 7 difficulty levels that were available. We worked in C++ and we needed to delegate responsibility between ourselves to solve the problems in an efficient way. Result: 13th place in Cluj-Napoca
  - BitDefender Programming Contest 2024 (21.04.2024). Me along with two of my colleagues each took on separate problems from the 15 provided and solved them in Python, mainly. Although we worked separately, we took frequent breaks to talk to give each other a status report and also to share ideas when we were stuck.
  - CodeRun Marathon (Nov. 2023). I participated in a series of seminars which taught us basic concepts of Django, SDL etc. Then, over the course of a weekend, our team of three had to go to different companies and solve tasks in each checkpoint in a given time frame. We worked in Python and C.
